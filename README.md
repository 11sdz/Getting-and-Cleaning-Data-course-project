# Getting and Cleaning Data (Coursera)
In this project we were asked to create clean and tidy data which also have descriptive variable names.
by reading the readme we can see that they record the data by 6 different activities in activity_labels.txt and 30 subjects who participated.
When looking on the data ( we used only X_test, X_train, y_test, y_train , subject_test , subject_train , and features. text files) we can see that their are 561 variables because of 17 variables on 33 measurments.
